# opam-source-archives -- opam repository archives

This repository contains the source code archives to various packages
that have had their original distribution locations removed from
the Internet.  The archives here match the checksums of the original
sources from the [opam-repository](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository).

Maintained by the opam development team.
